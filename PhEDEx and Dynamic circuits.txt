PhEDEx is the data-placement management tool for the CMS experiment at the LHC. 
It manages the scheduling of all large-scale WAN transfers in CMS, ensuring 
reliable delivery of the data. 

It consists of several components: an Oracle database, a website/data-service, 
a set of central agents and a set of site agents (at each of the PhEDEx sites).

PhEDEx maintains knowledge and history of transfer performance, and the central 
agents use that information to choose among source replicas when a user makes a request
The central agents then queue the transfer to be processed by the site agents. 
PhEDEx operates in a data-pull mode, the destination site pulls the data to itself
when it is ready. 

For our purposes in this paper, we're interested in the FileDownload. It's one of 
the site-agent, meaning, each site runs one or more copies of this agent. It is responsible
for the actual execution of file-transfers; it retrieves the transfer queue from
 the database, organises the files in whatever way is suitable for the actual 
 transfer tool that will be used, launches the transfer, monitors its progress,
 verifies the files have been delivered, and reports the transfer results via the database.
